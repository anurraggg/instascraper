Not all wheat is the same. Our grandparents always said their wheat was different and they were right.

Khapli wheat is an ancient grain, naturally low in gluten and almost twice the fibre of regular wheat. It supports digestion, sugar management and keeps you light yet satisfied.

That’s why I recommend Aashirvaad Khapli Atta made from ancient Khapli wheat, tested with 40+ quality checks, and ground for authentic chakki texture. 

Just 3 chapatis give you 34% of daily fibre, along with protein, iron and Vitamin B1.

Switch your daily atta, and feel the difference.

Hi.. One query .. When we soak all kinds of seeds overnight.. Do we roast them prior or simply soak them.. So many ppl on Instagram suggest roasting a lil.. Like kalonji jeera etc.. But I felt you are the best person to ask for a genuine answer.. Thanks

Surprisedly, we found from our survey, that the younger lots are missing out on Nuts and Dryfruits in their diets. And Why ? The morning rush leaves them with no time for Breakfast table.
