The most refreshing way to eat Moong dal, this crunchy, protein-packed koshimbeer is made truly healthy with organic moong dal from the Aashirvaad Organic range. 

Made this family favorite that Aai introduced to the family, and got Aai’s approval both for the taste as well as for using staples that are grown without chemicals and are pure. 

This small change of choosing organic, for better health is something we can all get behind, don’t you think?

Here’s the recipe, try it!

Ingredients: 

1 cup @aashirvaad organic moong dal soaked for 1-2 hours
¼ cup peanuts, soaked overnight/ in hot water for an hour 
1.5 tsp sugar 
1/2 cup packed grated coconut 
1/3 cup grated carrot, grated 
1/2 cup chopped cucumber 
1/3 cup pomegranate arils 

Lime juice, to taste
3 tbsp coriander, chopped 
Salt, to taste 

For tempering:
1.5 tbsp ghee 
3/4 tsp cumin seeds 
2-3 green chillies, chopped 

Method:
In a bowl first combine the moong dal, soaked peanuts and sugar.
Prepare and add the hot tadka to the moong dal and mix well.
Then, add the coconut, carrots, cucumber, pomegranate, lime juice, coriander and salt (as per taste).

Mix well and serve right away.
