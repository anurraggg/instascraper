High Protein Moong Dal Tikkis for kids

You know what makes a good snack for me? One that my daughter loves, and I know is nourishing too. Moong dal tikkis are a family favourite — high in protein & so tasty!

But what matters most is knowing the ingredients are clean and safe. That’s why I choose @aashirvaad Organic dals — grown without chemicals, tested for purity, and full of natural goodness I can trust for my family. 

This Organic Day, it’s a gentle reminder that switching to organic isn’t just about one meal — it’s about building healthier habits for the future.

Method: 
* Soak 1 cup moong dal for at least 2 hours or overnight, then boil till soft and drain well. 
* Heat 1 tsp oil in a pan & add ¼ cup onion (finely chopped) and sauté till golden. 
* Now add 1 tsp ginger garlic paste and cook for a minute. 
* Add ¼ cup grated carrot and cook for 2–3 minutes followed by ¼ cup grated paneer and stir well. 
* Then add the boiled @aashirvaad Organic Moong dal and mix. Add salt to taste, ½ tsp chaat masala, and ½ tsp red chilli powder followed by ¼ cup chopped coriander, ¼ cup besan, and ¼ cup oats flour. 
* Cook the mixture for 2–3 minutes till it comes together. 
* Switch off the flame and let it cool. 
* Once cool, shape into small tikkis & shallow fry till golden on both sides
