Benson Boone's song "Beautiful Things" is a ballad about a person's gratitude for newfound blessings, such as love and family, but also the intense fear and desperation of potentially losing these cherished things. The song features a dramatic shift from soft, soulful verses to a powerful, rock-influenced chorus where he pleads for his "beautiful things" to stay, reflecting the emotional turmoil of fearing loss while enjoying happiness.

No problem, here is some information about Al Merrick. He is one of the most legendary surfboard shapers in history, the founder of Channel Islands Surfboards, a company that has shaped the future of surfing since the 1960s. Al Merrick began making boards in his garage in Santa Barbara, California, in 1969, and his goal was simple — create surfboards that allowed surfers to push their performance to the next level. Over the decades, Channel Islands boards became the choice of champions like Tom Curren, Kelly Slater, Dane Reynolds and many others. With over 20 world titles won on his boards, Merrick’s designs changed competitive surfing forever. He introduced innovations in rocker, rail, and fin placement that made his boards faster, more responsive, and perfectly tuned to waves of all kinds. Today, Al Merrick’s boards are still considered some of the best in the world, blending craftsmanship, technology, and performance. His story proves how passion and dedication can turn a small garage project into a global surfing empire that inspires generations of surfers. 🌊

Roberto Carlos starred in a hilarious Pepsi commercial before the 2002 World Cup. In the ad, a boy hands him a Pepsi at the airport, and when the boy bows, Carlos responds with a deep, dramatic bow of his own. Later, during a free kick, even the wall of defenders and the goalkeeper bow in imitation — and in that moment, Carlos strikes the ball into the net. The commercial perfectly blends his legendary football skills with lighthearted humor, showing that even a global superstar can have fun off the pitch. It’s a clever mix of respect, comedy, and iconic talent that has made this ad one of football’s most memorable commercials.
