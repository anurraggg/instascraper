Sunday lunch at our home = chole-roti tradition 

While Nooru enjoys her favourite, I enjoy the peace ✌️ of knowing that the staples I cook with are pure and safe. 

With @aashirvaad Aashirvaad Organic☘️, every atta, dal, chawal, and rajma comes with the goodness of nature — grown naturally, ✅ tested for 200+ pesticides, and nurtured with care. 

Because for me, health isn’t just about recipes, it’s about what goes into them. 💚

Hi Tanya, would be really helpful if you could share all the educational kits that Noor has been using like class monitor, ginimini and so many others. And which are worth investing in? Thank you in advance. :)
