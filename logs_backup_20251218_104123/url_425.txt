India's Favourite Lunch: Roti, Aloo ki Sabzi, Rice, Dal and Aachar. It's full of flavour and love but it misses 1 Key Nutrient.

Protein--Which is why it is extremely important to build a Balanced Plate with enough Protein in it.

Here's how we've built it:
-3 High Protein Rotis (Using Aashirvaad Atta with High Protein)(For extra Protein and essential carbs)
-Low Fat Paneer Bhurji (For Protein and Calcium)
-Dal without Tadka (For Plant Protein and Carbs)
-Veggies (Carrots, Cucumber for Fibre and Vitamins)

Increasing the Quantity of Protein in our day-to-day foods is extremely essential for sustained energy levels, muscle building and immunity.

One such way to increase the quantity of protein in our food is by using @aashirvaad 's Atta with High Protein, that gives us an additional 15g Protein per 100g.
